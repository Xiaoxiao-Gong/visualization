# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      The bad data visualization example I select:
      https://www.behance.net/gallery/18012809/Ales-Agglomration-Evolution-de-la-population

      Description of the Chart:
      This chart uses a radial design to display population data across different years. Different shades of blue and concentric arcs represent the population size for each year. Numbers and years are placed on different
      circular segments, but the chart lacks a title and clear legend to explain the meaning of the data or its design intent.

      Analysis of Drawbacks:
      1. Difficulty in Data Comparison:
      Limitations of Radial Design, the circular design makes it difficult to compare data across years. For instance, the population difference between 2008 and 2009 is not easily distinguishable due to the distortion
      caused by the curvature. This design fails to meet the "accuracy" criteria (substantive qualities) discussed in class, as it does not allow for an intuitive comparison of data, potentially leading to
      misinterpretationâ€‹.

      2. Risk of Information Overload:
      Excessive Visual Complexity, the radial layout incorporates multiple colors and overlapping concentric circles, which may overwhelm viewers at first glance due to the excessive amount of visual elements. According
      to the class discussion on reducing extraneous cognitive load, charts should strive to be simple and clear, avoiding unnecessary design elements that could distract from the main messageâ€‹.

      3. Lack of Title and Legend:
      Absence of Context and Guidance, this chart does not include a title to explain its content, nor does it provide a legend to clarify the meaning of the color gradients or specific segments. As emphasized in class,
      titles and legends are essential components of data visualization, providing the audience with contextual information and enhancing interpretability (explanatory composition). Without these elements, viewers must
      spend additional effort to infer the chart's purpose, thereby increasing unnecessary cognitive loadâ€‹.

      ```
      The good data visualization example I select:
      https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lisa.trescott/viz/HowCommonIsYourBirthday_17222664505560/Birthday

      Description of the Chart:
      This circular chart shows the ranking of daily birth counts in the United States from 1994 to 2014. Each date is ranked from 1 to 366, with color gradients indicating frequency (darker colors represent more common
      birthdays). The chart includes an interactive feature for selecting specific dates to view their rank and average births.

      Analysis of Strengths:
      1. Clear and Intuitive Color Coding:
      The use of a gradient pink color scale effectively represents the ranking of birth frequencies, with lighter shades for less common birthdays and darker shades for more common ones. This design aligns with the
      discussion on "perceptual qualities" in class, as the contrast in colors helps viewers quickly grasp trends in the dataâ€‹.

      2. Strong Narrativity and Interactivity:
      The chart not only displays data but also provides clear explanations through textual annotations (e.g., "35th most common, 11,846 average births"). Additionally, the interactive dropdown menu allows users to
      explore specific dates, enhancing the user experience. This interactivity adheres to the "explanatory composition" principle discussed in class, guiding viewers in interpreting the data effectivelyâ€‹.

      3. Visually Appealing and Attention-Grabbing Design:
      The soft pink tones and clean layout are visually attractive, making the chart engaging for the audience. The balloon design on the left adds a playful touch while maintaining simplicity. This approach aligns with
      the principle of reducing "cognitive load," as it minimizes distracting elements and keeps the audience focused on the main informationâ€‹.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      For the bag data visualization example I select:
      https://www.behance.net/gallery/18012809/Ales-Agglomration-Evolution-de-la-population

      1. Adopt a More Traditional Layout for Comparisons:
      Replace the radial layout with a more conventional design, such as a bar chart or line chart. These formats make it easier to compare population data across years, as they align data points along a common axis.
      This would improve accuracy and align with the principles of "substantive qualities" by providing an intuitive way to compare trendsâ€‹.

      2. Simplify the Visual Design:
      Reduce the number of visual elements, such as overlapping arcs and varying shades of blue. Instead, use a single consistent style with minimal colors to focus the viewer's attention on the key data points. This
      change would reduce extraneous cognitive load, making the chart easier to interpret.

      3. Add a Title and Legend:
      Include a clear, descriptive title to provide context about what the chart represents (e.g., "Population Growth Over the Years") and a legend to explain the meaning of the colors and concentric arcs. This would
      help viewers understand the chart without needing to guess, enhancing both the interpretability and explanatory composition of the visualizationâ€‹.
      ```
      ```
      For the good data visualization example I select:
      https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lisa.trescott/viz/HowCommonIsYourBirthday_17222664505560/Birthday

      Enhance Color Accessibility: While the pink gradient is visually appealing, it may be challenging for colorblind users to distinguish between different shades. Adding numerical labels directly to the chart or
      incorporating additional design elements, such as patterns or symbols, would improve differentiation and make the visualization more inclusive. This aligns with the class discussion on creating accessible and
      inclusive visualizations
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
