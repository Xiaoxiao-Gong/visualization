# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        For the bad data visualization example:
        https://www.behance.net/gallery/18012809/Ales-Agglomration-Evolution-de-la-population

        Accessibility:
        The chart lacks a clear legend or explanation for the use of colors and visual elements, making it difficult to interpretâ€‹. The absence of proper annotations and a clean design increases the cognitive load for
        users, particularly for those with visual impairments or non-expert viewersâ€‹.

        Reproducibility:
        There is no indication of the data source or the specific code used to generate the chart, making it impossible to reproduceâ€‹. Without recorded data and visualization processes, it is challenging to verify the
        chartâ€™s accuracy and completenessâ€‹.

        Equity:
        The radial design fails to emphasize some years equally, which might bias the interpretation towards certain years while ignoring othersâ€‹. This design can mislead viewers and does not ensure a balanced
        representation of all data points.
        ```
        ```
        For the good data visualization example:
        https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lisa.trescott/viz/HowCommonIsYourBirthday_17222664505560/Birthday
        
        Accessibility:
        The chart uses a common bar chart format that is straightforward and easy to interpret, with clear color contrasts suitable for most usersâ€‹. This reduces cognitive load and enhances visual clarityâ€‹.

        Reproducibility:
        The chart includes clear numerical data and sources, making it straightforward to replicate using codeâ€‹. This transparency aligns with academic and professional standards, facilitating verificationâ€‹.

        Equity:
        The design evenly displays data for all months without bias or omissionâ€‹. This ensures that viewers can understand the birth distribution across all months equally, regardless of their background.
       
        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        For the bad data visualization example:
        1. Include a clear legend and color explanation to reduce cognitive load and make the chart more user-friendlyâ€‹.
        2. Provide access to the data source and code to ensure reproducibility and transparencyâ€‹.
        3. Adjust the design to balance the representation of all years, preventing any data points from being overlookedâ€‹.
        ```
        ```
        For the good data visualization example:
        1. Add a descriptive title or annotations to enhance accessibility for non-expert audiencesâ€‹.
        2. Optimize the color scheme for viewers with colorblindness or other visual impairmentsâ€‹.
        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

### Rubric:
| Component               | Scoring   | Requirement                                                 |
