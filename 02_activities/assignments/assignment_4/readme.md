# Assignment 4: Data Visualization

This project is a part of the **Assignment 4** for the Data Visualization module. It involves creating two different visualizations from the same dataset, using **Python** and **SAS programming**. The assignment is organized into three main folders:

## Folder Structure


### **1. data**
This folder contains:
- The **raw dataset** (Hospitalizations by vaccination status) used for this assignment.
- A text file (`dataset_link.txt`) that includes the link to the dataset source.

### **2. python_visualization**
This folder includes all files related to the visualization created using **Python**:
- **description.md**: A detailed explanation of the Python-generated visualization.
- **python_code.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used to generate the visualization.
- **hospitalizations_by_vaccination_status.png**: The final chart or visualization generated using Python.

### **3. other_tool_visualization**
This folder includes all files related to the visualization created using **SAS programming**:
- **description2.md**: A detailed explanation of the SAS-generated visualization.
- **sas_code.md**: Since GitHub may not support SAS code directly(I have no idea), the original SAS code has been converted and stored as a Markdown file.
- **other_tool_chart.pdf**: The final chart or visualization generated using SAS programming.
