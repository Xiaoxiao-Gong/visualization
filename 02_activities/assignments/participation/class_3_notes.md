class_3 code notes:

Libraries Used: NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas were used. NumPy for creating data arrays, Matplotlib for plotting, and Pandas for handling data tables.

Subplots: Created multiple plots on the same figure using different subplot arrangements such as columns, rows, and mosaic layouts. This helps in displaying multiple types of visualizations side-by-side.

Scatter Plot: Created scatter plots to visualize relationships between two variables. Used different colors and markers to differentiate between data sets.

Bar Plot: Created bar charts to compare data categories. Added titles and labels for better understanding.

Legend Placement: Adjusted the legend position and formatting to clarify data representation in each plot.

Text Annotations: Added annotations to highlight important values on plots. This makes specific data points stand out.

Axis Customization: Modified axis ticks, labels, and limits to improve chart readability. Removed labels or changed their appearance for clarity.

Font Styling: Adjusted font styles such as family, size, and color to make labels, titles, and annotations easier to read and visually appealing.

Styling and Layouts: Used different styles like 'fivethirtyeight' for aesthetics, experimented with subplot mosaic layouts, and adjusted figure sizes for a professional look.


Key Takeaways

Practiced creating scatter, bar, and line plots in different subplot configurations.
Learned how to adjust legends, add annotations, and customize axis formatting.
Developed skills to enhance visual appeal through styling and layout adjustments. These skills help make data visualizations clearer and more engaging.
