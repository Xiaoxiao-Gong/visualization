Class_1 code notes
Libraries Used: NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas were used. NumPy for numbers, Matplotlib for charts, and Pandas for handling data.
Scatter Plot: Made a scatter plot to show two variables. It helps to see patterns or relationships.
Bar Plot: Used bar charts to compare different groups. Good for showing differences.
Line Plot with Labels: Plotted a line to show how things change over time. Added a title and labels to make it clear what the chart shows.
Font Changes: Changed font styles like size, color, and type for titles and labels. Makes the charts easier to read.
Marker Changes: Changed the shape, color, and size of the markers in scatter and line charts. This helps make certain points stand out.
Line Style: Adjusted line colors, styles (dotted, solid), and thickness. Makes the lines more noticeable or clear.
Extra Styling: Customized marker edges and fills to look better. Helps charts look more professional.
